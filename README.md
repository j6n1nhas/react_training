Learning React

This is a repo with many small projects on the way to master React framework. I went to [React webpage](https://reactjs.org/community/courses.html) where they have a few courses to learn React, and chose the one from [University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

Each project is in it's own directory.
