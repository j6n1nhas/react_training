Learning React

This is a repo with many small projects on the way to master React framework. I went to [React webpage](https://reactjs.org/community/courses.html) where they have a few courses to learn React, and chose the one from [University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

Also downloaded the [Pure React book](https://www.pdfdrive.com/pure-react-a-step-by-step-guide-to-mastering-react-e196825777.html) by [***Dave Ceddia***](https://github.com/dceddia), an excellent book indeed; congrats and cheers mate!! Thanks for all your knowledge sharing!!!

And followed the [React official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

This, hard work and many nights took me to get quite an understanding about React.

Each part is in it's own directory and it has some different exercises in it, some of which are commented. Each step accomplished is in his own commit.
